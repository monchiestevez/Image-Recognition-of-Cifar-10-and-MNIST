# ImageRecognition of Cifar-10 and MNIST

Image Recognition of Cifar-10 and MNIST using Tensorflow

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy A.I

### Prerequisites

What things you need to have ready for the algorithm to work
```
- Have an IDE (I recommend PyCharm)
- Download the Cifar-10 dataset from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
- Have Python 3.X installed
```

### Installing

The installation process is usually short. You need to have prepared the prerequisites that are above


```
Download the script, create a project folder for it and paste it inside
```
```
Unzip the Cifar-10 and create a folder inside the project folder exactly called cifar-10-data 
```
```
Copy all the files inside the Cifar-10 zip and paste them in the cifar-10-data folder. (the files are called data_batch_1, data_batch_2, ..)
```
```
I recommend reading the code from the script to haver a better understanding of how it works. In future updates, I'm going to add coments so the code is more clear
```

## Built With
